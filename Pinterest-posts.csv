None have any behavioral or physical issues related to this procedure."",""Cats are incredible and sensitive beings, and their well-being should always be a top priority.

I had her declawed because she got her claws caught in my ceiling to floor sheer drapes and was hanging there for hours when I was out. The only thing I noticed after she was declawed was it changed who she was. She hated everyone but me.

Some call it overindulging, we call it sharing the love with our feline friends! Whatever you call it, there’s no denying that seeing our furbabies happy with spoils makes our hearts melt. One way that we love to spoil our pets is by making them homemade cat treats! The internet is full of easy cat treat recipes that we’re sure your kitty will love. The only problem is finding out which DIY cat food recipe you can trust and which homemade cat food ideas you must avoid. Instead of scrolling through pages of blogs, we’ve done the hard work for you! In this article, you will find everything from frozen delights, delicious gravy to bite-sized snacks. What’s even better is that these cat treat recipes are easy to make and can be a pawsome way to show your cat that you care. OUR BEST HOMEMADE CAT TREATS: Picky cat owners rejoice! Below you will find our list of DIY cat food ideas that we know your kitty will love. Cat Gravy Recipe Just like hooman babies, covering any unlikeable food in gravy is a parenting hack as old as time! If your cat is a little bit on the picky side, we highly recommend whipping up this yummy topping for their usual meals. What You’ll Need: ¼ cup of chicken liver ½ cup of a mixture of chicken gizzard and heart 2 cups of water 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour ¼ teaspoon of salt How to Make Cat Gravy: The first thing you’ll want to do is to get the chicken parts boiling in water. It’s best to keep this on the boil until the parts become tender. Once ready, remove the chicken and chop the pieces up. Make sure to store the stock aside- this will come in handy in the next section! Using your chicken stock, take a sauce pan and stir the stock in with the flour, meat, and salt. Keep this cooking over low heat while stirring from time to time until the gravy is at a thick consistency. Depending on your cat’s or the chef’s preference, blend your gravy into a puree. The benefit of a puree is that you can freeze into ice cubes and preserve it over an extended time. However, a chunkier gravy can be more up your cat’s alley and requires fewer dishes! Source: goingevergreen.com Cooling Catsicle Recipe WIth the added fur, cats tend to get warmer a lot quicker than us hoomans do. On those scorching hot summer days, your kitty will thank you for a delicious cooling treat. What You’ll Need: 1 can of wet cat food The same can’s worth of goat’s milk Small cat treats Ice cube trays How to Make Catsicles: Warning: this might not be a pretty process, but trust us, your cat will love it! The first step in making your catsicles is to decant the wet cat food and fill the empty can with goat’s milk. Combine these two ingredients and mix until well-blended. The look of this might not be attractive, but you’re almost done! Grab your ice cube trays and spray them with cooking spray for easy removal once ready. Next, spoon in your mixture and add your cat treat into each cube. When they’re ready, pop this into the freezer et voila! Source: homesalive.ca Catnip Cat Treats Recipe Is it just us or is catnip everywhere these days? If your cat likes to indulge in the occasional nip or two, this homemade cat food recipe is a must! What You’ll Need: 5 oz tuna in water drained 1 egg ½ cup of flour ¼ cup of wheat germ ½ cup of cornmeal ¼ cup of wheat flour ¼ cup of water ½ tablespoon of catnip How to Make Catnip Cat Treats: Before getting started, get your oven preheated to 350 degrees. You’ll want to do this first as your oven can take the longest to warm up while you get on with the rest of the homemade cat treats recipe. While you’re at it, make sure to line a cookie sheet with parchment paper so that you’re ready once the preparation is done. Now it’s time for the good stuff. Combine all the ingredients into a large bowl and form into a dough. It would be best if you aimed for a sticky consistency. When you’re happy with your dough, place it onto a floured surface, and get ready to roll up those sleeves! Pull off small pieces of the dough and roll them into small balls. Lastly, push the dough down, so the treat is the size of a nickel, and place on parchment paper. You’ll want to bake these treats for 20 minutes and only serve once completely cooled. Source: spcaouest.ca *Disclaimer, if you have any hesitations about using catnip, please consult your vet. Easy-Peasy 3-Ingredient DIY Cat Food We get it, the thought of making your own cat food over the convenience of buying it from the store can seem redundant. However, not only is it a healthy alternative, but it isn’t as complicated as you’d think! This 3-ingredient homemade cat treats idea is the perfect example of why. What You’ll Need: 10 oz canned salmon undrained 1 egg beaten 2 cups of whole wheat flour How to Make 3-Ingredient Cat Treats: Note: if you really want to step up your Pinterest game, we highly recommend sourcing a cookie cutter to reflect your cat’s personality. Your cat won’t notice, but your Instagram feed will love it! First thing’s first, switch your oven up to 350 degrees and prepare your parchment-lined baking sheet. As for the cooking section, pulse together your canned, undrained salmon in a processor. Don’t worry if you don’t have a processor, you can chop this as finely as possible too. When this has gotten to a paste-like consistency, add it to your egg and flour and mix together. You’re aiming for a tacky dough feel - if it’s too dry, add up to ⅓ cups of water, and if it’s too wet, add a bit more flour. Next, take your dough and roll it out onto a floured surface. Once rolled into a ¼ inch thickness, you can start shaping away with your cookie cutter. When you’re ready, bake these treats for 20 minutes or until they’re slightly browned and crunchy. Make sure to cool completely before serving! Besides the convenience, we love that these treats can be stored for up to 2 weeks in an air-tight container too!

"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/959759370572946998","959759370572946998","5 Smells Cats Hate vs. Smells Cats Like","Our cats may have tiny, adorable noses, but don’t be fooled. Their sense of smell is mighty. Seriously, their little heads are packed full of structures and organs that support their incredible olfactory senses! Plus they get an extra scent organ in their mouths. Where we humans must get by with a mere five million or so olfactory receptors for navigating life’s good smells and bad, our cats are on that next level: flaunting their 45 to 80 million receptors and smelling the roses from, like, two blocks away. (Maybe. Don’t quote me on the two blocks bit.) When cats love a smell, they love a smell and may spend a while excited and roll around in it. Or napping with it. Or chewing on it. (If permitted access, my giant orange tabby Tiger Jack will lick and chew the armpits out of my husband’s shirts. Yes, I know, that’s gross to us, but cat love means funk love. More on that later!) Smells they dislike, on the other hand? There’s going to be some sneering and shunning the inconsiderate area. Okay, but what smells fall into each category? Each cat is unique, we all know that, so their personal reactions may vary - but here are some smells likely to fall under the average cat’s YES GOOD and BOO HISS lists. 5 SMELLS CATS DISLIKE Citrus - I bet you knew this would be top of the list! Cats really don’t like citrus, whether oranges, lemon, grapefruit, etc. When you’re trying to train your cat away from a certain spot in your house, citrus is often the recommended deterrent. Mint - This one’s a toss-up, but cats who really dislike mint are demonstrating good sense: from peppermint to the wintergreen herb, these mints contain salicylate, a substance toxic to cats. Cayenne Pepper Capsaicin doesn’t just chase me away - it repels cats as well! Don’t use this one as a cat deterrent, even though you’ll find recommendations out there about using it to protect your garden. Capsaicin is enough of an irritant to the mouth - if the pepper gets on a cat’s paws, which they then use to groom around their eyes, it can really hurt - making you a jerk of the highest order. Cleaning Agents - Companies love selling us cleaning agents with various flowery or other strong smells - and these smells can be an assault on our cat’s senses. Exercise restraint with the “flowery meadow” or “lemon mists” scented detergents or sprays until you see how your kitty reacts to them. Their Own Cat Box - As we all know, cats are so fastidious that they bury their waste. (Good kitties!) And in their homes, the only place to do this is in a relatively small box. Given their incredible sense of smell and the property of lingering odors, you must practice good cleaning habits with the cat box or watch your cat decide to avoid it and do their business elsewhere. 4 SMELLS CATS LIKE Catnip - I know, obvious alert again! It is a truth largely accepted that cats love catnip, and there are about 359,000 videos on YouTube you can watch proving this. It all comes down to an oil called nepetalactone and what that does to your cat’s brain. Valerian - Valerian root can have a similar effect on your cats as catnip - excitement, and stimulation. Just be careful about their exposure to it and don’t let them have access to valerian unsupervised. Green Olives - Weird, right? But true! Some cats cannot get enough of the smell of green olives - my beloved cat Kaylee would rub herself all over a green olive if I gave her one, and then she’d attach herself to my hand until she rubbed all the olive oils off. It’s a thing! Your Funk - Okay, I’m not trying to be gross and I am only referring to a cat’s person’s funk. Cats certainly don’t love human funk in general - not every funk need apply - but they do love the funk of their particular people. They’re bonded to you; they’re scent-focused. It makes sense that they’d be attracted to your scent - which just happens to be strongest in places like your shoes or the armpits of your shirts. Hence why my silver tabby Daenerys tries to shove her face into my sneakers. Funky love. Scents are a driving force in cats’ lives and make up a large part of how they understand and navigate the world. They even use scents to communicate, whether getting a feel for the neighborhood from where other cats have sprayed or identifying other cats (and what may be different about them) by their signature scent. As friends to our own cats, it’s the least we can do to learn the likes and dislikes of each kitty we care for. So - what smells make your cats go YES GOOD or BOO HISS?

They can be used as a great diversion to keep your active dog busy and distracted while you’re busy. If you’re not familiar with a lick mat, a lick mat is a small, textured rubber or silicon mat with grooves that hold food. These grooves cause the dog to lick to remove their food. They are very popular and come in many shapes and styles Dogs love lick mats because they generally contain yummy treats but they also meet their need for mental stimulation and desire to work for their reward, in this case, food. They are also perfect for puppies. Benefits of a Lick Mat Lick mats, also known as lickimats and licking mats, can be used in a number of ways, including: Occupy a puppy while in their crate or during down time. Distracting from gardener, maintenance workers, etc. Relieving from stress or anxious behavior. Slowing down a fast eater. A reward for a job well done. Encouraging rest time. Providing mental stimulation. Occupies their time. Use to hide medication. Keeps them busy so you get a break, too. Licking Mat Recipes When filling up your dog’s lick mat, opt for recipes that will require them to lick or work to remove their food from the mat. Be sure to consider the calories you’re feeding your dog from their lick mat, since they can contain lots of extra calories. Since the size and depth of lick mats vary, we’ve put these recipes together as a guide and have not provided measurements. You can’t mess up the amounts if you use discretion about how much rich, fatty, or fattening ingredients you put on the lick mat. For example, don’t feed your dog more peanut butter or sardines than you normally would for a treat. If you want to build a bigger lick mat, opt for adding some kibble or wet food or healthy foods. When making the recipes, always use salt free, sugar free, and artificial sweetener free ingredients. Since more and more sugar substitutes are finding their way into so many products, always read the ingredients on anything marked sugar free or unsweetened, since the popular sugar substitute xylitol (also known as “birch sugar”) is deadly to dogs. Peanut Butter and Jelly Freeze Peanut butter Fresh fruit Yogurt Spread a thin layer of peanut butter in the lick mat and freeze. Top the peanut butter with their favorite smashed fruit, such as blueberries mixed with a couple of tablespoons of yogurt and re-freeze. Serve frozen or allow to thaw a bit. Pumpkin Cheesecake Pureed pure pumpkin Cream cheese Honey Cinnamon Mix pureed pure pumpkin, not the pie filling, a small amount of cream cheese, a teaspoon of honey, and a tiny dash of cinnamon. Spread into the lick mat and freeze until ready to serve. Something’s Fishy Wet dog food, pate style Canned sardines in water Mix wet dog food with a few crushed sardines and spread into the lick mat. Freeze until ready to serve. You’ll probably want to serve this stinky one outside. Chicken Pot Pie Minced Chicken Frozen peas and carrots Yogurt Bone broth This recipe is simple, mince some chicken, add frozen peas and carrots, mix in some plain yogurt, and then add couple of tablespoons of bone broth. Spread mixture into the lick mat and chill until set or you can serve warm but it will disappear faster. You can substitute any meat you wish. Sweet Potato Delight Cooked sweet potato Yogurt Honey Cinnamon Mash cooked sweet potato. Mix with a couple of tablespoons of plain yogurt, a small spoonful of honey, and a tiny dash of cinnamon. Mix well and freeze. Beef and Vegetables Raw, low fat ground beef Steamed broccoli Steamed carrots Parsley Mix raw ground beef (cook if you prefer) with minced steamed broccoli, carrots, and a tiny bit of parsley. Spread on lick mat. If you cook the ground beef, add a bit of wet dog food to bind the ground beef and vegetables into a spread. Fruity Dog Delight Banana Blueberries Strawberries Yogurt or peanut butter Smash banana and berries. Add some yogurt or peanut butter and mix well. Spread over lick mat and freeze. Licking Mat Ideas for Dogs on a Special Diet Dogs on a special diet can still enjoy a lick mat. You can try soaking their regular kibble with water or bone broth and then spreading it over their lick mat. You can also try mixing some safe and appropriate wet food or wet food mixed with kibble into the mat. If there are safe food and treats that are appropriate for your dog, consider mixing some into the kibble or wet food to add interest and variety to their experience. You can also try using alternate safe brands so that they’re not getting the same old thing. Fast Lick Mat Fillers Sometimes you just don’t have the time or ingredients to whip up a lick mat recipe. When this happens, your dog will still love using their mat. Rather than mixing up a recipe, you can also alternate single ingredients onto different compartments of the mat. Here are some quick filling ideas that are easy to keep on hand: Canned pumpkin (not pie filling) Baby food Peanut butter Applesauce Cream cheese Yogurt Smashed vegetables Blueberries Eggs Dog treats soaked in water or broth Kibble soaked in water or broth Wet dog food Smashed sardines How to Wash Your Lick Mat The easiest way to wash your lick mat is to soak it in hot, soapy water them scrub with a brush or toothbrush. Some lick mats are also dishwasher safe but by giving them a good once over, you can help remove any food particles stuck in the crevices. We hope your dog enjoys these lick mat recipes.

I can tell he is absolutely loving the bed."" - An Impressed Hooman. ✅ Proven to ease anxiety ✅ Vet-approved ✅ Comfy. So comfy even hoomans fall in love ✅ Built with pet-safe materials ✅ Easy to clean Dog experts discovered that as many as 1 in 4 dogs experience consistent anxiety on a daily basis. When left untreated, the anxiety may worsen and lead to a range of complications, anywhere from behavioral problems to severe loss of appetite and worse, a shorter life span. While many loving pawrents make it our utmost priority to provide the best lives possible to our fur children, many of us lack the time, tools or knowledge to do so. Introducing Calming Cloud™️ - The #1 Voted Dog Bed for easing anxiety in dogs. Designed to imitate the comfort of a mother's fur coat, Calming Cloud™️ is crafted with top-notched nylon fabric and finished with a luxurious faux fur exterior, giving the most comfortable sleeping experience imaginable to our beloved pets. Say Goodbye to Anxiety Calming Cloud™️ is specifically crafted with a raised rim to induce a sense of security in pets - giving them the feeling of a mother's hug and ultimately eases their last straw of anxiousness. Super Comfortable One of the most common responses we get from pawrents is that Doggo and Hooman should create Calming Cloud™️ for the pawrents themselves too. Give it a try and let us know! Promotes Better Sleep Calming Cloud™️ makes our pets feel safe and relax, which in turn lets our pets sleep better, longer and more rejuvenating. FAQ Is Calming Cloud™️ made with pet-safe material? Crafted with premium, non-toxic and durable PP Cotton, Calming Cloud™️ is both safe for our pets and environment. Which Size Should I Choose? It is recommended to measure your dog before making a decision. You know your dog better than anyone on how your furkid likes to sleep. We always recommend sizing up if your furkid loves to have more space. Our beagle loves to take up a lot of space while she sleeps therefore we choose two sizes larger for her for max comfort :) This bed is pawfect for your doggo and cat Keep in mind that the size guide and the suggested dog breeds are intended for reference only.  Size Outer Diameter  Suggested Breeds XS 16"" / 40cm Chihuahua (Small), Pomeranian (small), Toy Breeds, Puppies & Cats S 20"" / 50cm Chihuahua (Large), Pomeranian (Large), Bichon Frise (Small) & Cats M 24"" / 60cm Bichon Frise (Large), French Bulldog (Small), Shih Tzu, Maltese, Dachshund, Yorkshire Terrier L 28"" / 70cm Jack Russell, French Bulldog (Large), Cocker spaniel XL 32"" / 80cm Bulldog (Small), Beagle, Boxer, Bull Terrier, Pug 2XL 35"" / 90cm Bulldog (Big), Basset Hound, Pitbull, Labrador, Golden Retriever, Collie 3XL 39"" / 100cm Rottweiler, German Shephard, Labrador, Golden Retriever, Siberian Husky, German Longhair, Hovawart, Collie 4XL 43"" / 110cm Dalmation, St. Bernard, Great Dane, German Short Hair Pointer, Dobermann   What is the Best Practice to Take Care of this Product?

They must be waiting for her to finish playing I should go say hi to her” and then I realised that we’re not friends anymore. So I just put my hood up and walked past the tennis courts faster."",""Yes. Bad butterflies is the wording I didn‘t know I was looking for. I‘ve been scarred by some of my longest, deepest friendships in more ways than one. And I still grieve the parts of those relationships that were wonderful and full of warmth. The thing is just that those moments of joy can‘t compensate for the longer, underlying structures of hurt forever and they certainly can‘t fix them. It‘s just so hard to accept this when you know—the love WAS there. You know it was."",""I had a best friend named Alyssa (same name as me) and she ended up moving. Broke my little heart. I remember getting into my car and just broke down crying in the backseat. My dad even remembers looking back and seeing my head against the seat in front of me just sobbing. He got out of the car and comforted me. And I still think about her to this day and I’m 18…"",""My first and only closer friendship I had just naturally grew apart a few years ago when we both changed and learned more about ourselves, but it was never officially a spoken thing that we stopped being friends, we spoke a last time very awkwardly and never communicated again. For a couple years after we stopped talking, I was having the worst year and would cry on the bathroom floor over it, wishing I’d found a way to address it and move on rather than just awkwardly stop talking"",""please stop, i'm still trying to get over all the friendships i've lost, especially when my first best friend and i split up. a couple of years have passed and it still hurts so fluffing much. now i have trust issues and i can't believe anyone wants to be friends with me anymore..like..some classmates talk to me and spend time with me and call me a friend, but i don't think they actually think of me as a friend and i can't imagine anyone becoming friends with me..why would they, i'm so annoying"",""I miss my middle school best friend. I get sad thinking if her bc I'm scared she'd be mad at me for losing contact for so long or that she thinks I dont remember her but I do bc I dont have many friends. wherever she is I hope shes doing well and I hope that shes found happiness through all this madness. I treasure all our happy memories, I wish we would have had more time to be friends ㅠㅠ"",""My brother is one of the people I love the most. He has been.. weird lately - ever since he got a girlfriend he's been cold, distant and weirdly detached from our family. And let me tell ya, this is hurting me more than any crush ever did."",""This is literally the worst feeling. I've had a few of those- both people i was really good friends with but one day they had to move away or they stopped going to the only place we would see each other. I wasn't good enough friends with them to have any of thier social medias or their phone numbers so I just kinda lost them. it sucks bc i really wanted to get to know them and I really cherished every conversation i had with them but theres nothing i can do to get them back."",""I had a really close friend, we stuck together through everything. One day they randomly left, no text, no call, nothing. It hurt, it hurt worse than any romantic breakup I'd ever experienced."",""I get really attached to people way too easily and its a plus really when trying to make new friends but after three of my friends (people I’ve talked to daily for months or even years) and i sense a fourth coming “friend-dumped” me I’m slowly giving up on the idea of having friends at all"",""So my best friend of 3ish years just recently stopped talking to me cuz the place we both work (she helped get me the job so I could quit my shitty one) gave me (someone who had manager and more customer service experience) a manager position over her. She never even told me she wanted it but that shouldn’t matter. After all this time I finally realize that she never cared about me, or she would’ve been happy for me."",""My therapist said I was traumatized from the loss of multiple friendships and that’s why I’m having such a hard time making friends now. So you know, that’s nice."",""Like my very first heart break was platonic and it was aweful and I felt like nobody could understand that it hurts so much because I didn't know at all that it was a thing (and btw it even included the \""let's just take a break from this friendship\"") Also we managed to find a way back and it is definetly different now, but that is not a bad thing"",""My best friend of 5 years suddenly started to ghost me one day and even though I begged for an explanation, I never got one. It hurt so much, but when I told people about it they always laughed about me."",""I have movie recommendation, south indian movies in tamil language: \""thozha\"" (boy-boy platonic) and \""priyamana thozhi\"" (boy-girl platonic). in Amazon prime.

Our Beauty Product Specialist is here to help. Send an emailWhat It Is: Ambery and woody, tobacco exhales its most beautiful facets in contact with honey.   Fragrance Notes: Top Notes: Sesame, Anise, Cloves.Middle Notes: Honey, Oud Wood, Vanilla.Base Notes: Tobacco Accord, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood Accord.   What It Does: Touched by honey, tobacco turns to gold. A contrasting olfactory tension is struck between the golden sheen of honey and the intoxicating vibrancy of the tobacco accord.   A deliciously ambery tobacco accord is enveloped in vanilla, Tonka bean, and sesame before being enlivened under the vibrant brightness of heady honey, then heightened by aniseed accord and clove. At the base, the precious accord reinforces its trail of woody notes combining a blend of sweetly creamy sandalwood and powerful oud wood.   To the music of honey, Delphine Jelk plays tobacco’s most beautiful score in a melody of warm, ambery notes.   If it were a masterpiece, a patchwork of tobacco leaves like an Arte Povera land art. The scent of Tobacco Honey may call to mind a piece of Italian Arte Povera land art, the avant-garde art movement born in the 1960s that included works presenting materials in their raw state.   Reprising this creative approach, Tobacco Honey exalts an assemblage of tobacco leaves with a thousand nuances.   The Art of Bottling: Taking inspiration from the Guerlain heritage Square Bottle (1870) and made by Pochet du Courval - historic glassmakers of the House - the L’Art & La Matiere bottle is an exceptional object whose design exudes unisex sophistication steeped in modernity.   L'Art et La Matiere Collection: Crowning jewel of Guerlain Fine Perfumery, L’Art & la Matiere is a collection of olfactory masterpieces for true lovers of all things beautiful.
